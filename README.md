# `pet-imaging-tools`

`pet-imaging-tools` is a collection of tools, functions and scripts that can be useful for data processing in the context of PET image reconstruction.

The tools are written in Python and cover tasks such as Monte Carlo data processing and filtering or list-mode data manipulation. The scope of the project is not (yet) completely well-defined — anything that relates to PET data processing and image reconstruction fits.

The focus is put on ease of installation and ease of use for research purposes, not on performance or suitability for any clinical application. As such, those tools are obviously not suited for any medical application whatsoever.

`pet-imaging-tools` is designed to be both usable as a library (i.e. importing functions in other Python scripts) and as a command-line tool.
